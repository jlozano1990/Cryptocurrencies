# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment for an investment bank.

## Results
We were able to group the data about cryptocurrencies using K-Means and were able to visualize the results with a 3D scatter plot, a table that has all the information about tradeable cryptocurrencies readily available and allows you to organize it in different ways, and finally with a 2D scatter plot to show the relationship between coin supply and coins mined organized by coin name.
